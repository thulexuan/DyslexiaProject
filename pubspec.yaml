  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/tessdata/
    - assets/test.txt
  fonts:
    - family: Arial
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/arial.ttf
    - family: Times New Roman
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/times.ttf
    - family: Heuristica
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Heuristica-Regular.otf
    - family: Courier
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/VPSCOURT.TTF
    - family: Verdana
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/verdana.ttf
    - family: Helvetica
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Helvetica.ttf
    - family: Comic Sans

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
